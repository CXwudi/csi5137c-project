But consultancies are everywhere and the need for frictionless communication makes it hard for anyone to switch. Trying to improve adoption at any costs is really really important for software that so heavily suffers and benefits from network effects. Most people will always default to the most adopted suite even if it is the worse piece of software. At some point when the software is good enough accelerating adoption is actually more important than improving the software itself.\n\nWhen you have a good adoption, like 20-30%, then we can speak about this step, which in itself I like -- but it just won't work for now.\n\nNow I think this step will criple adoption.

2,12,2,Is 64 Bit coming for Windows?,"hi

Does anyone know if there is a 64 Bit version for windows planed?  
I am sure that it would make my workflow much quicker if I could use more Ram.  


Sorry if this is a silly question.","[""Isn't Audacity already 64 bit?"", ""The Windows version is complied as a 32-bit binary for compatibility and ease of maintenance of binaries. They only started offering 64-bit binaries on MacOS because Apple was stopping support for 32-bit native apps. Windows will support 32-bit for quite some time. Regardless, it's open source and you're welcome to compile the source into a 64-bit Windows binary. \n\nI'd be more curious as to what audio projects you're working on that are requiring more than 2GB of RAM for Nyquist-based plug-ins to access (the entire selection is loaded into RAM), which is the only advantage you're going to be getting with 64-bit binaries over 32-bit ones on Windows.""]"
27,79,2,PSA: Audacity which versions to use without telemetry - data collection,"We tried to warn users wondering what Audacity version is ""safe"" to download and install after the new owner, Muse Group, announced that they would integrate data collection in Audacity.

FossHub has been the official mirror of Audacity since 2014. We've seen many people recommending the latest version as 2.4.2 (without data collection/telemetry) from our old repository, which is NOT true.

The latest version that does not use data collection is 3.0.2. All the previous versions, such as 3.0.0, don't have any networking capabilities. The Audacity team has warned that there are specific bugs in older versions, so if you're comparing version 3.0.0 with 3.0.2, this one is the smart choice.

The code that will provide basic data collection will be integrated into version 3.0.3. However, the team has announced that opt-out is available before installing Audacity.

Therefore, we believe there are two options. Keep using version 3.0.2 or an older, stable version such as 2.4.2 or use the latest Audacity version and opt-out from data collection/telemetry, considering this will always be an option.

Considering, we have been the official mirror for seven years. We believe the safest place to download an old Audacity version is [**our old Audacity repository**](https://www.fosshub.com/Audacity-old.html). All files have been scanned with the Jotti malware scan service, they are uploaded manually on VirusTotal, and the file signatures will match those released by the Audacity team.

Note: We are NOT recommending you to stop using newer Audacity versions. This is a post regarding the wrong information posted on the Internet, claiming that 2.4.2 and older versions are safer than 3.0.0 or 3.0.2. We cannot express an official position for the reasons mentioned in our [blog post](https://blog.fosshub.com/audacity-old-version-without-data-collection-telemetry/).","['> The code that will provide basic data collection will be integrated into version 3.0.3\n\nSo, do you plan to host 3.0.3 in your site?', 'Interesting that the official mirror is suggesting using an older version.\n\nBut, going forward, it looks like using the fork Tenacity could be the way to go.', '[deleted]', 'Why did you sell it in the first place?', 'So, I guess we just have to trust that they\'re not lying about the ""opt out"".

0,12,1,Computer crashed while recording 6 channel audio!,"Hello there,

I was recording a 6 channel audio file at my office and our Mac it was on crashed just as we were wrapping up.  I had saved the project before starting and I have a 2 gig DATA folder, but Audacity seems to not want to repair or recover the file, and the recovery program doesn't seem to like more than 2 channels of audio.

Does anyone know of a way to repair a 6 channel audio file? Or even if anyone knows the sequence of the smaller files in the data folder so we can reconstruct it all?

Any help is appreciated.",[]
