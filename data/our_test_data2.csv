But consultancies are everywhere and the need for frictionless communication makes it hard for anyone to switch. Trying to improve adoption at any costs is really really important for software that so heavily suffers and benefits from network effects. Most people will always default to the most adopted suite even if it is the worse piece of software. At some point when the software is good enough accelerating adoption is actually more important than improving the software itself.\n\nWhen you have a good adoption, like 20-30%, then we can speak about this step, which in itself I like -- but it just won't work for now.\n\nNow I think this step will criple adoption. The little money you'll make with it might help improving the software, but as I said you will end up with the better software that no-one will use professionally.

27,79,2,PSA: Audacity which versions to use without telemetry - data collection,"We tried to warn users wondering what Audacity version is ""safe"" to download and install after the new owner, Muse Group, announced that they would integrate data collection in Audacity.

FossHub has been the official mirror of Audacity since 2014. We've seen many people recommending the latest version as 2.4.2 (without data collection/telemetry) from our old repository, which is NOT true.

The latest version that does not use data collection is 3.0.2. All the previous versions, such as 3.0.0, don't have any networking capabilities. The Audacity team has warned that there are specific bugs in older versions, so if you're comparing version 3.0.0 with 3.0.2, this one is the smart choice.

The code that will provide basic data collection will be integrated into version 3.0.3. However, the team has announced that opt-out is available before installing Audacity.

Therefore, we believe there are two options. Keep using version 3.0.2 or an older, stable version such as 2.4.2 or use the latest Audacity version and opt-out from data collection/telemetry, considering this will always be an option.

Considering, we have been the official mirror for seven years. We believe the safest place to download an old Audacity version is [**our old Audacity repository**](https://www.fosshub.com/Audacity-old.html). All files have been scanned with the Jotti malware scan service, they are uploaded manually on VirusTotal, and the file signatures will match those released by the Audacity team.

Note: We are NOT recommending you to stop using newer Audacity versions. This is a post regarding the wrong information posted on the Internet, claiming that 2.4.2 and older versions are safer than 3.0.0 or 3.0.2. We cannot express an official position for the reasons mentioned in our [blog post](https://blog.fosshub.com/audacity-old-version-without-data-collection-telemetry/).","['> The code that will provide basic data collection will be integrated into version 3.0.3\n\nSo, do you plan to host 3.0.3 in your site?', 'Interesting that the official mirror is suggesting using an older version.\n\nBut, going forward, it looks like using the fork Tenacity could be the way to go.', '[deleted]', 'Why did you sell it in the first place?', 'So, I guess we just have to trust that they\'re not lying about the ""opt out"".

Does it literally download spyware malware, or is it just nicknamed that because it gives off information? And what info does it give off? I don't really care if it gives off info about errors or stuff like that, but if it shares my computer screen or passwords or whatever i really dont want that**.**","['From the Audacity Team:\n\n[https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/1225?fbclid=IwAR1nTVMf\\_bWl\\_uxoOIw9x9Ixo8EGCtckSUdx8krabPQkvTGcKkFhxFZ-Jlw](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/1225?fbclid=IwAR1nTVMf_bWl_uxoOIw9x9Ixo8EGCtckSUdx8krabPQkvTGcKkFhxFZ-Jlw)\n\n* Selling Data & Sharing - We do not and will not sell ANY data we collect or share it with 3rd parties.

It's a Source-available commercial freeware app with analytics at this point and it's a good thing that people are outraged about that. I also think the current privacy policy is in violation of the GDPR which is in fact illegal and can be fined with $10M.\n\nSee: https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/1213 and https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/1229""]"
